# Ouroboros

Ouroboros is a work in progress app for 8ch.net. It is currently in it's alpha stages and should not be held as a representative of the final product. During this stage of development the code base should be considered highly unstable and prone to both crashes and usability issues. It's layout is very heavily inspired by Chanobol and the design of Montanax's unreleased app Miko.
