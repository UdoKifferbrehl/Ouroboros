# Ouroboros

Ouroboros is a work in progress app for 8ch.net. It is currently in it's beta stages and should not be held as a representative of the final product. It's layout is very heavily inspired by Chanobol and the design of Montanax's unreleased app Miko.

## ~~"Help I can't see all posts"~~
~~The reason why is because 8chan's APIs are limited right now. Catalog.json is restricted to 3 pages and (pagenumber).json is suffering from the same problem. I can't really fix this until 8chan makes the information available through the API.~~

8chan staff might have fixed this.
